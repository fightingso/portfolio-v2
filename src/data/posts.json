The <code>HMR</code> was absolutely instantaneous.</p>\n<h2>Hosting</h2>\n<p>I also tried <a href=\"https://vercel.com/\">vercel</a> to host this blog. Hosting was extremely simple and easy. Setting the custom domain also was easy. Probably the best hosting service I've used so far.</p>\n<h2>Other stuff</h2>\n<p>I made a <a href=\"https://github.com/K-Sato1995/md-to-json-converter\">package</a> that converts markdown files into JSON for this.</p>\n",
